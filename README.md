# Meme Masher

Mashes memes. Wouldn't have been possible without [PillowImageProcessingDemo](https://github.com/nspilman/PillowImageProcessingDemo) by [nspilman](https://github.com/nspilman).

## Requirements
- Python 3.7
- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

## Installation

Inside the repo directory...

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip # If pip wasn't freshly installed
pip install pillow numpy progressbar2 TwitterAPI
```

Only two files are included in the `images` directory - for more variety, fill it with files of [any format that Pillow can read](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html#:~:text=Pillow%20reads%20JPEG%2C%20JFIF%2C%20and,standard%20and%20progressive%20JFIF%20files.)!

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```
